The moonlight shimmered on the petals of the single blue rose—her grandmother’s last enchanted gift. She whispered the name she'd hidden in her heart for years. Wind stirred. A figure appeared from the shadows: Elias, lost to war, now returned. \"You remembered,\" he said, eyes glistening. Lena nodded, tears falling. Time bent briefly for love. As dawn approached, Elias faded with a smile. The rose wilted. She touched its petals, feeling both sorrow and peace. Love, though fleeting, had come back—if only for a night."}]}
